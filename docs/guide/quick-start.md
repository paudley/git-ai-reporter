# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Git AI Reporter in 5 minutes. This guide walks you through your first analysis from installation to reviewing the generated documentation.

## üöÄ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Git AI Reporter

Choose your preferred installation method:

=== "PyPI (Recommended)"

    ```bash
    pip install git-ai-reporter
    ```

=== "uv (Faster)"

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv pip install git-ai-reporter
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paudley/git-ai-reporter.git
    cd git-ai-reporter
    docker build -t git-ai-reporter .
    ```

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the generated key

!!! tip "Free Tier Available"

    Google Gemini offers a generous free tier that's perfect for getting started. You can analyze small to medium repositories without any cost.

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

=== "Environment Variable"

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

=== ".env File"

    ```bash
    # Create .env file in your project directory
    echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' > .env
    ```

=== "Shell Profile (Persistent)"

    ```bash
    echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Step 4: Run Your First Analysis

Navigate to any Git repository and run:

```bash
# Analyze the current repository for the last 4 weeks
git-ai-reporter

# Or specify a different repository
git-ai-reporter --repo-path /path/to/your/project

# For a quick test with minimal output
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1 --debug
```

### Step 5: Review Generated Files

After processing completes, you'll find three new files:

```bash
ls -la NEWS.md CHANGELOG.txt DAILY_UPDATES.md
```

- **üì∞ `NEWS.md`** - Stakeholder-friendly development narrative
- **üìã `CHANGELOG.txt`** - Technical changelog following Keep a Changelog format  
- **üìÖ `DAILY_UPDATES.md`** - Day-by-day development chronology

## Common First-Run Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Project (< 50 commits)

```bash
# Perfect for small projects - quick and comprehensive
git-ai-reporter --weeks 2

# Typical output:
# ‚úÖ Found 23 commits across 2 weeks
# ‚úÖ Analyzing commits (Tier 1): 23/23 complete
# ‚úÖ Generating daily summaries (Tier 2): 14/14 days
# ‚úÖ Creating final narratives (Tier 3): Complete
# üìù Generated: NEWS.md, CHANGELOG.txt, DAILY_UPDATES.md
```

### Scenario 2: Medium Project (50-200 commits)

```bash
# Good balance of depth and processing time
git-ai-reporter --weeks 4

# Expected processing: 2-5 minutes
# Focus on meaningful changes with intelligent filtering
```

### Scenario 3: Large Project (200+ commits)

```bash
# Start with shorter timeframe for initial test
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1

# Then expand to full analysis
git-ai-reporter --weeks 4 --no-cache  # Force fresh analysis
```

## Customizing Your First Analysis

### Focus on Specific Time Periods

```bash
# Specific date range
git-ai-reporter --start-date "2025-01-01" --end-date "2025-01-31"

# Last N weeks
git-ai-reporter --weeks 6

# Since last release tag
git-ai-reporter --since-tag v1.0.0
```

### Adjusting Output Detail

```bash
# More detailed analysis (slower, higher quality)
git-ai-reporter --weeks 2 --temperature 0.3

# Faster analysis (less detail)
git-ai-reporter --weeks 2 --temperature 0.7
```

### Debug Mode for Troubleshooting

```bash
# See what's happening under the hood
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1 --debug

# Dry run - see what would be analyzed without making API calls
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1 --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting First Run

### Common Issues and Solutions

??? failure "API Key Not Found"

    **Error:** `GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set`
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Check if variable is set
    echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
    
    # Set for current session
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    
    # Or create .env file
    echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"' > .env
    ```

??? failure "No Git Repository"

    **Error:** `Not a git repository or no commits found`
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Verify you're in a Git repository
    git status
    
    # Or specify repository path
    git-ai-reporter --repo-path /path/to/your/repo
    
    # Check if repository has commits
    git log --oneline -n 5
    ```

??? failure "Permission Denied"

    **Error:** `Permission denied when writing output files`
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Check directory permissions
    ls -la .
    
    # Use different output directory
    git-ai-reporter --output-dir ~/git-reports
    
    # Or run with appropriate permissions
    sudo git-ai-reporter  # Not recommended
    ```

??? failure "API Rate Limits"

    **Error:** `API rate limit exceeded`
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Use smaller time window
    git-ai-reporter --weeks 1
    
    # Enable caching to avoid re-processing
    git-ai-reporter --cache-enabled
    
    # Wait and retry (rate limits reset)
    sleep 60 && git-ai-reporter
    ```

### Performance Expectations

| Repository Size | Commits | Processing Time | API Calls |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Small | 1-50 | 30-90 seconds | 50-70 |
| Medium | 51-200 | 2-5 minutes | 200-250 |
| Large | 201-500 | 5-15 minutes | 500-600 |
| Very Large | 500+ | 15+ minutes | 500+ |

!!! tip "First Run is Slowest"

    The first analysis takes the longest because nothing is cached. Subsequent runs on the same repository are much faster due to intelligent caching.

## Next Steps After First Run

### 1. Review and Understand Output

Take time to read through each generated file:

- **üì∞ NEWS.md** - Share with stakeholders and project managers
- **üìã CHANGELOG.txt** - Include in release notes and documentation  
- **üìÖ DAILY_UPDATES.md** - Use for team retrospectives and planning

### 2. Customize Configuration

Create a `.env` file to customize behavior:

```bash
cat > .env << EOF
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
MODEL_TIER_1="gemini-2.5-flash"
MODEL_TIER_2="gemini-2.5-pro"
MODEL_TIER_3="gemini-2.5-pro"
TEMPERATURE=0.5
TRIVIAL_COMMIT_TYPES="style,chore"
EOF
```

### 3. Set Up Regular Analysis

Add to your workflow:

```bash
# Weekly analysis (recommended)
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1

# Monthly comprehensive review
git-ai-reporter --weeks 4

# Release preparation
git-ai-reporter --since-tag $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

### 4. Integrate with Your Workflow

Consider automation options:

- **Git Hooks** - Automatic analysis on push
- **CI/CD Integration** - Analysis in your pipeline  
- **Scheduled Jobs** - Weekly automated reports
- **Release Process** - Include in release preparation

## Example Workflows

### Development Team Workflow

```bash
# Monday morning: Review last week
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1

# Before releases: Complete analysis  
git-ai-reporter --since-tag v1.2.0

# Monthly retrospective: Comprehensive review
git-ai-reporter --weeks 4
```

### Product Manager Workflow

```bash
# Focus on stakeholder narrative
git-ai-reporter --weeks 2
# -> Share NEWS.md with stakeholders

# Track specific features
git-ai-reporter --start-date "2025-01-01" --keywords "authentication,api"
```

### DevOps Integration

```bash
# Automated in CI/CD
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1 --output-dir ./reports
# -> Archive reports as build artifacts
```
