## Best Practices

### Content Quality

1. **Regular Generation:** Run weekly for optimal detail and accuracy
2. **Review and Edit:** AI-generated content benefits from human review
3. **Stakeholder Feedback:** Gather feedback on format effectiveness
4. **Consistency:** Maintain regular generation schedule for best results

### Audience Targeting

1. **NEWS.md:** Focus on business impact and user value
2. **CHANGELOG.txt:** Emphasize technical accuracy and completeness  
3. **DAILY_UPDATES.md:** Balance detail with readability for team use

### Version Control Strategy

1. **Commit Separately:** Each format serves different review processes
2. **Branch Strategy:** Consider separate branches for different audiences
3. **Archive Policy:** Maintain historical versions for reference
4. **Access Control:** Different permission levels for different formats

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to output formats:

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Web-based visualization of generated content
- **Custom Format Support:** Plugin system for organization-specific formats
- **Multi-Language Support:** Localized content generation
- **Integration APIs:** Direct publishing to documentation platforms
- **Collaborative Editing:** Team review and editing workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Format Issues

??? failure "Inconsistent information across formats"

    **Problem:** Different numbers or facts in different files.
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Regenerate all formats together
    git-ai-reporter --weeks 2 --force-refresh
    
    # Check for caching issues
    git-ai-reporter --no-cache
    
    # Validate configuration consistency
    git-ai-reporter --validate-config
    ```

??? failure "Poor formatting or structure"

    **Problem:** Generated content doesn't follow expected format.
    
    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    # Use higher quality model for final generation
    MODEL_TIER_3="gemini-2.5-pro"
    
    # Lower temperature for more consistent formatting
    TEMPERATURE=0.3
    
    # Increase token limits for detailed formatting
    MAX_TOKENS_TIER_3=32768
    ```
