## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v0.1.0

This is the initial release, so no migration is required.

**New Installation:**

```bash
pip install git-ai-reporter
```

**Configuration:**

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
git-ai-reporter --weeks 1
```

## Breaking Changes

### v0.1.0

No breaking changes in initial release.

**Future Breaking Change Policy:**
- Breaking changes will increment major version number
- Deprecation warnings provided for one minor version before removal
- Migration guides provided for all breaking changes
- Backward compatibility maintained within major versions

## Security Updates

### v0.1.0

**Security Features:**
- Secure API key handling implemented
- Input validation and sanitization throughout
- No data persistence of sensitive information
- Secure defaults for all configuration options

**Supply Chain Security:**
- PyPI attestations for verified builds
- Dependency pinning and security scanning
- Regular security updates for dependencies
- Secure CI/CD pipeline implementation

## Performance Improvements

### v0.1.0

**Baseline Performance:**
- Sub-3-second processing for individual commits
- Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- Intelligent caching reducing API costs by 60-80%
- Memory-efficient processing for repositories with thousands of commits

**Optimization Features:**
- Async-first architecture for I/O operations
- Intelligent prompt fitting preserving data integrity
- Configurable concurrency limits for different environments
- SHA-based caching for commit analysis results

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

**AI Model Dependencies:**
- Requires Google Gemini API access
- Performance dependent on API response times
- Costs scale with repository size and analysis frequency

**Repository Size:**
- Very large repositories (>10,000 commits) may require longer processing times
- Memory usage scales with concurrent operations

**Output Format Limitations:**
- Currently supports markdown and text formats only
- Limited customization of output templates

### Workarounds

**Large Repositories:**
- Use date range limiting (`--start-date`, `--end-date`)
- Reduce concurrency limits for memory-constrained environments
- Consider repository splitting for extremely large monorepos

**API Costs:**
- Enable caching for repeated analysis
- Use appropriate model tiers for different use cases
- Consider batch processing for multiple repositories

## Upcoming Changes

### Next Release (v0.2.0) - Planned

**New Features:**
- Additional output format support (HTML, PDF)
- Enhanced plugin system with marketplace
- Advanced filtering and customization options
- Integration with popular project management tools

**Performance Improvements:**
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Optimized memory usage for large repositories
- Improved concurrent processing

**Documentation:**
- Video tutorials and walkthroughs
