# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and productive environment for all. This is a project where we value technical contributions and civil discourse above all else. All contributors are welcome, regardless of background, so long as they engage constructively with the community.

## Our Standards

We are all adults. We expect all participants to act professionally and treat each other with respect.

- **Focus on the code.** Keep discussions, critiques, and pull requests focused on the technical merits of the work.
- **Be respectful.** Disagreements happen, but personal attacks, trolling, and harassment will not be tolerated.
- **Assume good faith.** All communications should be assumed to be made in good faith unless proven otherwise. People communicate differently - some are direct, others are verbose, some use humor that doesn't translate well. Try to see the good intention behind the words before taking offense.
- **Be constructive.** When providing feedback, offer specific suggestions for improvement rather than just criticism.
- **Stay on topic.** Keep discussions relevant to the project and its technical goals.

## What We Don't Tolerate

- Deliberate personal attacks or sustained hostile behavior after being asked to stop
- Harassment, intimidation, or threatening behavior
- Deliberately disruptive behavior that impedes project progress
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Bad faith participation (e.g., arguing in circles, refusing to engage with technical points)

## Enforcement

The project owner is the ultimate arbiter of what is and is not allowed in this project and reserves the right and freedom to remove any content or contributor at their discretion.

While this Code of Conduct provides general guidelines, maintainers will generally try to clarify misunderstandings and give people the benefit of the doubt before taking action. However, patterns of genuinely disruptive behavior will be addressed.

## Reporting

If you experience behavior that you believe is genuinely disruptive to the project (not just communication style differences), please report it by contacting the project maintainers. Focus on the impact to the project rather than personal offense.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is focused on creating a professional, technical environment where contributors can focus on building great software together.
